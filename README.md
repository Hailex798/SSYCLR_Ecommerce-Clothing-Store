## üåü **Architecture Overview**

The architecture of SSYCLR has been carefully designed for scalability, modularity, and maintainability. Below is a high-level overview:

1. **Component-Based Design**:  
   All features and UI elements are implemented as reusable React components, enabling rapid development and consistent design.  

2. **State Management**:  
   Global state is handled using **Context API**, minimizing prop drilling while ensuring efficient data flow across components.

3. **Authentication Layer**:  
   Firebase Auth0 is used to manage secure and scalable OAuth-based user login, including token-based authentication.

4. **Persistent Storage**:  
   The cart is persisted in **local storage**, ensuring user actions are not lost due to page reloads or browser closures.

5. **APIs**:  
   All product data is fetched dynamically via APIs, allowing for integration with real-world product catalogs.

## üìà **Future Scope and Enhancements**

The platform has been designed with future improvements in mind. Below are some potential additions:

1. **Payment Gateway Integration**:  
   Incorporate payment solutions like Stripe or PayPal for order processing.  

2. **Order History and Tracking**:  
   Enable users to view and track past purchases.  

3. **Database Integration**:  
   Replace local storage with **MongoDB** or another NoSQL database for persistent and secure storage.  

4. **Full-Stack Transition**:  
   Upgrade the platform to a **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) for a complete full-stack experience.

5. **Wishlist Functionality**:  
   Allow users to save products for later purchases.
